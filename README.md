# telegramBotForNothing
Everything that I tested in the telegram bot is collected here.

For this to work you need to install some python libraries, namely
pyTelegramBotAPI, SpeechRecognition, mysql-connector-python.

This can be done with the commands:

`pip install pyTelegramBotAPI
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install mysql-connector-python`

You also need to download and put the "ffmpeg.exe" file in the "transcribe_audio folder"

Well, I almost forgot you need to install the "mysql" database and configure it, but you can handle it yourself ;)
